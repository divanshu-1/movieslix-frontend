# üé¨ MoviesLix - Frontend

> A learning-focused fork of [03sid-sharma/movieslix-Frontend](https://github.com/03sid-sharma/movieslix-Frontend)

This project is the frontend of a full-stack MERN movie streaming web app. I forked it to explore how a real-world React application works ‚Äî from routing and API calls to token handling and component structure.

## üöÄ Tech Stack (Frontend)

- **React.js**
- **React Router DOM** ‚Äì for page navigation
- **Axios** ‚Äì for making HTTP requests
- **JWT-based Authentication** ‚Äì via backend API
- **Responsive UI Design** ‚Äì using modern styling

---

## üß† What I Explored & Learned

- How React handles dynamic routing, protected routes, and user state.
- How frontend communicates with backend for login/signup and data fetch.
- LocalStorage usage for storing tokens.
- Debugging API responses and managing UI accordingly.
- How component structure and props/state flow in a working React project.

## üìå My Role

> I did **not** build this project from scratch. This is a forked project used purely for **learning and hands-on practice**.

Here‚Äôs what I actually did:

- Set up the frontend locally and connected it to the backend API.
- Studied the authentication flow and route protection logic.
- Made some small UI tweaks to test component behavior.
- Used this as a base to understand how full-stack apps are built.
